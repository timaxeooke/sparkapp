# This is the main repository for the SPARK application

##Start up:
*make sure that react-native is installed:
  -```npm install -g create-react-native-app```
*Clone this entire repo
*run ```npm-install```

##Running:
*run ```react-native run-ios``` from inside the directory
*That should open up an ios-simulator (on a mac. I have no idea about android sims, or doing anything on windows)
